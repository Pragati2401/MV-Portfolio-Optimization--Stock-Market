The project explores portfolio optimization using ETL, the Mean-Variance model, and R for stock analysis from Yahoo Finance, targeting risk-reward balance through diversified asset weights to outperform SP500.

1. SQL and PostgreSQL for ETL: Utilized SQL and PostgreSQL for an efficient ETL process, integrating and managing large financial datasets from Yahoo Finance. This facilitated robust data handling and advanced querying essential for financial analysis.

2. Portfolio Optimization in Excel: Applied the mean variance model in Excel to optimize stock portfolio asset weights, aiming to achieve a superior risk-reward ratio compared to the SP500TR. Excel's capabilities were key in simulating investment scenarios and calculating optimal allocations.

3. Predictive Analytics for Education: Created predictive models using SQL and Tableau to forecast student dropout probabilities, providing actionable insights for educational improvement through detailed business intelligence reporting.
